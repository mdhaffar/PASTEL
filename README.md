# PASTEL corpus
An open corpora for Automatic Speech Recognition research and development.
The data was collected from the project CominOpenCourseware (COCo) which provides a number of videos with potential resources (video, slides, time alignment of the video with the slide changes) and from the canal-U platform which is an online digital video library of higher education.
All the videos were manually transcribed by an expert human annotator using the Transcriber tool.
The databases consist of around 10 hours.
